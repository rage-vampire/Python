	r"""Decorate a function to signify its deprecation.

	This function wraps a method that will soon be removed and does two things:

	* The docstring of the method will be modified to include a notice
	  about deprecation, e.g., "Deprecated since 0.9.11. Use foo instead."
	* Raises a :class:`deprecation.DeprecatedWarning`
	  via the :mod:`warnings` module, which is a subclass of the built-in
	  :class:`DeprecationWarning`. Note that built-in
	  :class:`DeprecationWarning`\s are ignored by default, so for users
	  to be informed of said warnings they will need to enable them -- see
	  the :mod:`warnings` module documentation for more details.

	:param deprecated_in: The version at which the decorated method is considered
		deprecated. This will usually be the next version to be released when
		the decorator is added. The default is :py:obj:`None`, which effectively
		means immediate deprecation. If this is not specified, then the
		``removed_in`` and ``current_version`` arguments are ignored.
	:no-default deprecated_in:

	:param removed_in: The version or :class:`datetime.date` when the decorated
		method will be removed. The default is :py:obj:`None`, specifying that
		the function is not currently planned to be removed.

		.. note::

			This parameter cannot be set to a value if ``deprecated_in=None``.

	:no-default removed_in:

	:param current_version: The source of version information for the currently
		running code. This will usually be a ``__version__`` attribute in your
		library. The default is :py:obj:`None`. When ``current_version=None``
		the automation to determine if the wrapped function is actually in
		a period of deprecation or time for removal does not work, causing a
		:class:`~deprecation.DeprecatedWarning` to be raised in all cases.
	:no-default current_version:

	:param details: Extra details to be added to the method docstring and
		warning. For example, the details may point users to a replacement
		method, such as "Use the foo_bar method instead".

	:param name: The name of the deprecated function, if an alias is being
		deprecated. Default is to the name of the decorated function.
	:no-default name:

	:param func: The function to deprecate. Can be used as an alternative to using the ``@deprecated(...)`` decorator.
		If provided ``deprecated`` can't be used as a decorator.
	:no-default func:

	.. versionchanged:: 0.2.0  Added the ``func`` argument.
